        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Egg fried rice—and fried rice in general, really—is a huge part of Asian cuisine. We know how much Filipinos love rice, and for other Asian countries this is no different. From Thailand to India to Japan, each nation has their own version of fried rice that they know and love. Even the Philippines has its own different variants and renditions! Indeed, fried rice is a very generic term that houses a lot of cultures across different countries. But Chinese fried rice is almost transcendental in its fame; its being beloved worldwide.</p>
            <p>No fuss, no frills, all deliciousness—that’s the magic of the glorious egg fried rice. Whether you’re busy working or drowning in school requirements, no quick fix meal speaks to the heart like this takeaway staple. By simply tossing all its ingredients together, egg fried rice is one of the easiest and most delicious meals you can make. It’s got all sorts of elements that appeal to every palate—the sweet, the savory, the spicy. A meal all on its own, learning how to make this dish isn’t just a must for the busy bees, but for everyone!</p>
            <p>Egg fried rice has Chinese origins; like the Philippines, China has a bunch of different fried rice recipes of its own. This variant of fried rice may be one of, if not the most basic.
